                I was in my early teenage years when the world of computing
                opened its doors to me.{" "}

            <p data-oid="j3.8lo:">
                Picture a younger version of me huddled outside my neighbors
                house trying to connect to the internet because of curiousity ,
                learning the ropes by exploring the internet doing "digital
                mischief" by exploring the Windows system and sometimes actually
                causing trouble to the neighbor&apos;s kids to my parents.
                That&apos;s after seeing my brother super interested in
                technology and computers. I was like "what is this all about?"
            </p>
            <p data-oid="e6pme_u">
                It was a wild introduction to computing technology. Years passed
                and I found myself tinkering with smartphones and laptops,
                changing its stock ROM to custom ROMs and changing the OS
                installed, respectively. I had a lot of fun doing it, making me
                curious how software worked in general.
            </p>
            <p data-oid="79lx2yb">
                It was then that I realized what career I wanted to pursue and
                so I took BS in Software Engineering in university.
            </p>
            <p data-oid="jggrcr.">
                Now, I am into software engineering and machine learning.
