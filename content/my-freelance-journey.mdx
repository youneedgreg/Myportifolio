Starting out in freelance web development was a leap into the unknown, but it’s been an incredibly rewarding experience. Through the years, I’ve worked with various clients across different sectors all the while having a full time job.

## 1. **TIMCO PH**

<div className="py-2">
    <Image
        alt={`TIMCO PH`}
        src={`/images/blog/my-freelance-journey/timco-ph.png`}
        width={1280}
        height={720}
        className="border border-gray-200 dark:border-neutral-700"
    />
</div>

**A modern website for a local company.**

TIMCO PH needed a site that reflected their professionalism. I worked on a modern, responsive design using Laravel. The project allowed me to hone my skills in Blade and SEO, ensuring the site was optimized for search engines and fast loading times.

## 2. **CLA Footwear**

<div className="py-2">
    <Image
        alt={`CLA Footwear`}
        src={`/images/blog/my-freelance-journey/cla-footwear.png`}
        width={1280}
        height={720}
        className="border border-gray-200 dark:border-neutral-700"
    />
</div>

**A fresh e-commerce platform.**

For CLA Footwear, I created an online store. The site was built using a combination of Next.js and Tailwind CSS, ensuring that it was responsive and fast.

## 3. **Auto Promo PH**

<div className="py-2">
    <Image
        alt={`Auto Promo PH`}
        src={`/images/blog/my-freelance-journey/auto-promo-ph.png`}
        width={1280}
        height={720}
        className="border border-gray-200 dark:border-neutral-700"
    />
</div>

**A showcase project using the MERN stack.**

I had the opportunity to create Auto Promo PH, an app designed to manage promos for car dealerships. The tech stack involved React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. As a personal project, it allowed me to sharpen my full-stack development skills, particularly in handling real-time updates and customer data.

## 4. **SALIKSIK: UPHSL Research Repository**

<div className="py-2">
    <Image
        alt={`SALIKSIK: UPHSL Research Repository`}
        src={`/images/blog/my-freelance-journey/saliksik.png`}
        width={1280}
        height={720}
        className="border border-gray-200 dark:border-neutral-700"
    />
</div>

**A platform for organizing and accessing academic research.**

This project gave me hands-on experience with PHP and MySQL, where I designed and developed a web app for the University of Perpetual Help System Laguna. The platform allows students and faculty to upload and retrieve research papers seamlessly. This is part of our Capstone Project but wanted to display it here anyway as it was actually used by the University.

Working on these projects has been a great way to not only apply my skills but also to learn from each client’s unique needs. Freelancing has allowed me to experiment with new tools, stay updated with the latest technologies, and most importantly, see the tangible impact of my work.

As a developer, there’s nothing more fulfilling than seeing a live project that you built from the ground up. Each project is a new adventure, and I look forward to many more in the future.
