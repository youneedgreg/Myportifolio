Starting out in freelance web development was a leap into the unknown, but it's been an incredibly rewarding experience. Through the years, I've worked with various clients across different sectors all the while having a full time job.

## 1. **TIMCO PH**

    <Image
        alt={`TIMCO PH`}
        src={`/images/blog/my-freelance-journey/timco-ph.png`}
        width={1280}

        className="border border-gray-200 dark:border-neutral-700"
    />
</div>

**A modern website for a local company.**

TIMCO PH needed a site that reflected their professionalism. I worked on a modern, responsive design using Laravel. The project allowed me to hone my skills in Blade and SEO, ensuring the site was optimized for search engines and fast loading times.

## 2. **CLA Footwear**

        height={720}
        className="border border-gray-200 dark:border-neutral-700"
    />
</div>

**A fresh e-commerce platform.**

For CLA Footwear, I created an online store. The site was built using a combination of Next.js and Tailwind CSS, ensuring that it was responsive and fast.

Working on these projects has been a great way to not only apply my skills but also to learn from each client's unique needs. Freelancing has allowed me to experiment with new tools, stay updated with the latest technologies, and most importantly, see the tangible impact of my work.

As a developer, there's nothing more fulfilling than seeing a live project that you built from the ground up. Each project is a new adventure, and I look forward to many more in the future.
