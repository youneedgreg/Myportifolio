    **Disclaimer:** My site is my “breakable toy”. I enjoy and _intentionally_
    change technology and try new patterns here. I'd encourage you to do the
    same and then write about why you made those choices.

I was using the traditional HTML and CSS (with Bootstrap) for my portfolio site. This was fine, but I didn't like having to deal with the staticity of the site every time I will add new data to it. Everything is hardcoded and I was getting frustrated every time I make changes to the site.

Like many others, I needed to improve my skills so I started learning React. I immediately saw how extremely competent it is and how creating dynamic websites become easier due to its features. So I decided to redesign and replace the technology I used on my portfolio site with React.

As a way to study, I also incorporated in this portfolio the use of markdowns, such as the one I used writing this note.

I also added a Guestbook feature where visitors can leave their thoughts.

I'm planning on recreating this portfolio website using Next.js once I get the hang of using React.
