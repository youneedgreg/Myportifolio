I've been actively job hunting lately, and reading job descriptions became part of my daily routine. The problem? Some of the requirements listed make me sigh before I even hit the “Apply” button.

There was a time I felt guilty not learning every tool in the software development field. New CSS frameworks, JS frameworks, libraries. I tried so many I couldn’t even remember all the things I'm learning.

Yes, I could force myself to learn and like them. But I realized—after a bit of self-talk—that it's okay not to.

Productivity was suffering. Switching tools for the sake of “being current” was draining me.

So I pulled back.

Now I stick to what works for me—React (Next.js), Tailwind, Laravel, MySQL. It's not boring if it gets the job done well. I’m faster, cleaner, and more confident when I’m in my zone. If a tool doesn’t spark joy or solve a real problem I have, I’m skipping it. If need be, I'll just learn it while using it.

So instead of chasing tools to impress employers, I’m focusing on telling a better story around what I _am_ good at.

It’s freeing. And to be honest, it’s made job searching suck a little less.

Still, I’m not rigid. If a role genuinely calls for tools I don’t currently use, I’m more than willing to adapt and learn fast—especially when the work is meaningful and the team aligns with my values.
