## Content Management

So one day during our usual team planning, our boss asked:  
**“We need to support multiple languages for the app. Can you handle that?”**

I was like, “Yes, I can do it.” Internally? I'm screaming.

I had zero real experience with internationalization (i18n) or localization (l10n), and now I was responsible for making sure our app could talk to users from different regions—8 different languages-and not embarrass myself in the process.

After a short panic, I got to work. I ended up using **i18next** with **react-i18next**, and surprisingly, it wasn’t as scary as I thought. Here’s the gist of what I did:

- Created JSON files for each language we needed (starting with **en.json** and **es.json**)
- Used the **useTranslation** hook in our components
- Stored the language preference with **AsyncStorage** so it would persist between sessions
- Updated our UI to adapt to longer strings and minor layout shifts

The tricky parts were:

- Handling plural forms and dynamic values in translation strings
- Making sure dates and currencies formatted correctly based on locale
- Testing every screen to avoid weird UI breaks (some translations were _looooooong_)

But hey — it worked! The app now supports multiple languages, and I actually learned a lot about building for users beyond the default “English-speaking dev” assumption.

Moral of the story: When you're tasked with something you’re unsure about, lean into it. You might just surprise yourself.

I’ll be doing the same setup soon for a Next.js project. Now that I’ve been through the pain once, I feel way more confident tackling it on the web side.

Next stop: RTL support. Wish me luck. 😅
