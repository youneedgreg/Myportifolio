# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building modern web applications. In this guide, I'll walk you through the essential steps to get started.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages:
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- Built-in routing
- Image optimization
- TypeScript support out of the box

## Setting Up Your First Project

1. Create a new Next.js project:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

2. Navigate to your project:
```bash
cd my-app
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Key Concepts

### Pages and Routing
Next.js uses a file-system based router. Files in the `pages` directory automatically become routes.

### Data Fetching
Next.js provides multiple ways to fetch data:
- `getStaticProps` for static generation
- `getServerSideProps` for server-side rendering
- `getStaticPaths` for dynamic routes

### Styling
You can use:
- CSS Modules
- Tailwind CSS
- Styled Components
- Global CSS

## Best Practices

1. Use TypeScript for better type safety
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Optimize images using the Next.js Image component
4. Use environment variables for configuration
5. Implement proper SEO practices

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. Its features and developer experience make it an excellent choice for both small and large projects.
