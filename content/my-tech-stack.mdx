## 1. Framework (Next.js and React)

I’ve been working with **Next.js** and **React** for a while now, and I’m most productive in these technologies. All my projects start with **TypeScript** for the added type safety and structure.

When it comes to data fetching, I lean towards using the latest React patterns:

- **Mostly:** Server Components for efficient server-side rendering.
- **Occasionally:** React hooks + Context for state management, Tanstack Query.

For forms, I leverage React 19 features like **Server Actions** and **useActionState**, alongside **zod** for type-safe object validation inside actions. But I still find myself, at times, using third-party libraries such as **react-hook-form**.

## 2. Styling (Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui)

Building reusable and accessible components can be a challenge. That’s why I use **shadcn/ui**, which provides a well-designed set of extensible components. This helps me create flexible components without reinventing the wheel.

The styling? All handled with **Tailwind CSS** — a go-to for its efficiency and ability to colocate styles with markup. This makes it easier to work with code, especially when integrating AI tools.

## 3. Database (Laravel and MySQL)

For databases, **MySQL** is my default choice. And with **Laravel**, managing and creating APIs becomes effortless and enjoyable.

## 4. AI Tools (ChatGPT)

**AI** is a major part of my workflow. Whether it's for refactoring, debugging, or simply speeding up development, I rely on **AI tools** to save time and reduce manual effort. I use AI for tedious tasks like restructuring code, writing JSON, or suggesting improvements, especially when working with tools like **Next.js** and **React**.

While not perfect, AI is already a massive time-saver.

## 5. Coding Patterns

- Prefer `const` over `let` for consistency.
- Split large files into many smaller, focused components.
- Colocate code that changes frequently.
- If an abstraction isn’t necessary, it’s better to copy/paste for clarity.
